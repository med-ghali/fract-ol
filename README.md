fract-ol is an interactive fractal visualization project developed in C, utilizing the powerful MLX (MiniLibX) library for graphical rendering. Fractals, complex mathematical patterns that exhibit self-similarity at various scales, are brought to life in this project through an intuitive 
and engaging user interface.
Features:

Multiple Fractal Types: FractalVis supports a variety of popular fractal types, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, and more. Users can choose from a menu of fractal options to explore and visualize.

Real-time Rendering: Leveraging the MLX library's capabilities, FractalVis provides real-time rendering of fractals. Users can zoom in and out, navigate, and observe intricate details of fractal structures as they dynamically evolve on the screen.

User Interaction: The project offers a range of user interactions to enhance the exploration experience. Users can click on specific regions to generate new fractals centered around those coordinates, providing an interactive and customizable journey through fractal landscapes.

Color Schemes: FractalVis includes customizable color schemes for rendering fractals, allowing users to adjust the visual aesthetics and gain deeper insights into the fractal patterns.

Zoom and Pan: Users can zoom in and out of fractal regions and pan across the fractal plane using intuitive controls. This feature enables the discovery of intricate patterns and structures at different scales.

Save and Share: FractalVis allows users to save their favorite fractal renderings as high-resolution images, enabling them to capture and share their explorations with others.

Performance Optimization: The project is designed with performance in mind, utilizing efficient algorithms and optimizations to ensure smooth rendering and interaction even for complex fractals and high levels of zoom.

Educational Resources: FractalVis includes documentation and explanations about different fractal types, how they are generated, and the underlying mathematics. This makes the project not only a tool for exploration but also a learning resource for those interested in fractals and computational art.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: FractalVis is developed to be cross-platform, ensuring that users can enjoy the exploration of fractals on various operating systems.

This project aims to provide an accessible and visually appealing platform for users to dive into the captivating world of fractals. Whether you are a mathematics enthusiast, an artist, or simply curious about the beauty of mathematical patterns, FractalVis invites you to embark on a mesmerizing journey of discovery and creativity.
